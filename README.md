# FocusBoard
My Focus Board is a simple and intuitive task management application designed to help users organize, track, and prioritize their tasks across various stages:
- **New:** Newly created tasks
- **Planned:** Tasks scheduled for future action
- **Active:** Tasks currently in progress
- **Overdue:** Tasks past their due date
- **Completed:** Finished tasks

Tasks can have priority labels such as *Normal* or *Critical*, due dates, and editable details. The app also supports a dark mode toggle for user preference.
